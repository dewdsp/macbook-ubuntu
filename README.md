Outline
Here‚Äôs an outline of what‚Äôs needed to run this experiment:

download a Linux ISO image
extract the kernel and initrd files from it
build the command line client vftool to launch the VM
launch the VM and connect to it
install Docker
fix an issue with aufs, which (I believe) is due to running from a live CD
None of these steps are overly complex. In fact many of them are simple copy-and-paste commands for the command line. Let‚Äôs go through them one by one.

Download the Linux ISO image
To get this to work we need an ARM Linux ISO image. I didn‚Äôt do a whole lot of research and ended up downloading an image from this link: 64-bit ARM (ARMv8/AArch64) desktop image.

Then we follow the instructions as laid out in Jacopo‚Äôs README:
```bash
sudo mkdir /Volumes/Ubuntu
sudo hdiutil attach -nomount ~/Downloads/focal-desktop-arm64.iso
sudo mount -t cd9660 /dev/diskN /Volumes/Ubuntu # see below for how to determine N
open /Volumes/Ubuntu/casper
```

In order to determine which partition number N to use, check the output of the hdiutil attach command:
```bash
‚ùØ sudo hdiutil attach -nomount focal-desktop-arm64.iso
/dev/disk4              FDisk_partition_scheme
/dev/disk4s1            0xCD
/dev/disk4s2            0xEF
```
We‚Äôre looking for the FDisk_partition_scheme partition.

Extract vmlinuz and initrd
We have now mounted the ISO image and opened the folder with vmlinuz and initrd, which we‚Äôre looking to extract. Copy them to the folder alongside your ISO image.

In order to be able to launch the kernel image, you need to unzip it as follows:

```bash
cp vmlinuz vmlinuz.gz
gunzip vmlinuz.gz
```
### Build vftool
Next we‚Äôll compile the command line tool to boot the vm. Clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evansm7/vftool
cd vftool && xcodebuild
```
The binary is in build/Release and you can verify it‚Äôs running by launching it without arguments:

```bash
‚ùØ ./build/Release/vftool
Syntax:
./build/Release/vftool 
Options are:
-k  [REQUIRED]
-a 
-i 
-d 
-c 
-b  [otherwise NAT]
-p 
-m 
```
### Launch the virtual machine
Now we‚Äôre ready to launch the Linux VM. I‚Äôve copied vftool to the folder containing the ISO image and files vmlinuz and initrd and am running it as follows:

```bash
./vftool -k vmlinuz -i initrd -d focal-desktop-arm64.iso -m 4096 -a "console=hvc0"
```
Doing so should give you the following output:
```bash
‚ùØ ./vftool -k vmlinuz -i initrd -d focal-desktop-arm64.iso -m 4096 -a "console=hvc0"
2020-11-26 20:18:25.753 vftool[5068:113057] vftool (v0.1 25/11/2020) starting

2020-11-26 20:18:56.846 vftool[5068:113446] +++ VM started
```

The important bit here is the terminal (tty) the VM is listening on: /dev/ttys004. This is how we are going to connect via screen:
```bash
screen /dev/ttys004
```

## Set Datetime
```bash
sudo date --set "15 DECEMBER 2020 11:40 AM"
```
Connecting to the tty will start the VM‚Äôs boot process and you should see the familiar Linux boot sequence before arriving at the login screen:


The default user for the image I‚Äôve linked to above is ubuntu, with no password.

## Installing Docker
Now that we‚Äôve logged in, we can install Docker following the usual instructions. In a nutshell:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
Note that we‚Äôre specifying [arch=arm64] here, so be careful when copy-pasting instructions, because the Docker instructions will be showing amd64 instead, for the x86 version.

For easier launching of Docker without sudo, let‚Äôs add ubuntu to the docker group and re-login:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su - ${USER}
```
### Run Docker
We‚Äôre almost there now, just a small issue to fix with an error which you‚Äôll see if you run a docker container now:
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

See 'docker run --help'.
```
This error probably relates to us running off a live CD image and Stack Overflow has a work-around:
```bash
sudo sh -c "cat < /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "storage-driver": "vfs"
}
EOF"
sudo service docker restart
```

With this we can successfully launch a container üéâ
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
One thing to bear in mind is the following the Docker docs have to say about the vfs driver:

The vfs storage driver is intended for testing purposes, and for situations where no copy-on-write filesystem can be used. Performance of this storage driver is poor, and is not generally recommended for production use.

It shouldn‚Äôt be hard to fix this issue properly (and please get in touch if you know how!) but in the meantime, this is already helping me run tests against a Postgres database running in Docker entirely on my M1 machine ‚Äì and I hope it will help you get started with Docker on Apple Silicon as well.# macbook-ubuntu
